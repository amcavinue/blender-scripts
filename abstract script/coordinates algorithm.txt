Algorithm to move coordinates

***This way guarantees no intersection.

Start from center of last object
move in a random direction (yz) - so long as no overlap on end - one middle section away
    no overlap on end:
        

extrude plane to coordinates of end of last object
move in the same direction (yz), one end section away

extrude again in random direction
scale randomly


Inputs:
    last:
        center
        end
    2 ago:
        end
        end scale size
